        My Design:
        1. initialize an int array
        2. Find the largest number of the array, and save it as the last element in the array.
        3. Repeat 2. to find the largest number in the rest (length-1) elements, and save it as the 2nd last element in the array.
        4. Keep repeating until the array is sorted.
